# Google PlayStore Download Data and Charts

On the following project you can see data about Google Store downloads apps. The charts represented are comparing 
and relating different aspects of the variety of downloaded apps from Google PlayStore.

## Getting Started

To be able to enjoy all the charts together it's adviced to used a desktop viewport so a full view of 
all charts: relations and comparisons will be possible.

This comaprison can be observed by clicking in one of the charts and seeing how this affects the rest of 
charts.


## Motivation

What really motivated me to do make these charts was the curiosity to see what type of apps were downloaded more and 
what age group was more interested on which type of apps.

This project exists so people could learn more about what type of apps are downloaded the most.

This project has been created to help: 
1. Developers to make their apps knowing the interest of their public.
2. Marketing: to know who are the most porpular app nowadays.
3. Curios people who would liket to find out more about Google Play Store Downloads Apps


## Code style

I have used a standard code style. 


 
 
 ## Tests

- Reset All button: It has been tested and all the three charts are interacting with each other after clicking on one of the charts.

## Features

1. This project show a relationship between the different comparison charts. This comparison is 
shown trhow changing the color and size of each piece of chart in relation to the other charts. 
This feature makes the charts being more readable and easy to understand.

2. _Reset all Button_
    This button allows the user to reset all the charts to the beginning point at any time.

3. When the viewport is resize the charts will restart automatically.
